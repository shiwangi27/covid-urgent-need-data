# covid-urgent-need-data
This repo consists of the Twitter statuses data asking for urgent need help and resource availability data.

*Disclaimer: This is purely data scraping from Twitter, the availability of resources are not verified.* 

The data consists of the following:

- Resources Available
- Urgent Needs 

Currently, the tweet status data is pulled and filtered for May 1 for Mumbai and Delhi. Other cities to follow. The location is actually user's location and not the location of patients or resources (it can be all over the country). 


Hope this helps track ad-hoc resource availability for people in need.
